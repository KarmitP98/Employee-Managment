      Riot police were deployed in force as youths set cars ablaze in some
      low-income housing estates in the Paris suburbs overnight, online news
      reports and postings on Twitter showed on Wednesday, amid tensions
      heightened by the coronavirus lockdown.

      The latest unrest in the banlieues – high-rise, low-income neighbourhoods
      – flared after an 18-year-old died last weekend in a motorbike accident in
      the suburb of Argenteuil.

      An investigation into the death of Sabri Choubi was ongoing, said the
      prosecutor’s department for the district of Pontoise, which handles
      judicial matters for Argenteuil. It added that initial findings did not
      show Choubi’s motorcycle had been in a collision with a police car, as
      some of the victim’s associates had alleged.


      Officials at the Paris police department could not be immediately reached
      for comment on the unrest overnight, but the AnonymeCitoyen twitter feed
      and residents in the suburb of Argenteuil posted videos and photographs of
      burnt out cars and riot police in the area.

      Residents in the nearby suburb of Bezons also posted videos on Twitter of
      a large fire, though it was unclear what was burning.


      France’s banlieues are frequently flashpoints of anger over social and
      economic inequality and allegations of heavy-handed policing.
