    <h4>Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent
        will not: nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with
        talent. Genius
        will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will
        not: the
        world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and
        determination alone are
        omnipotent.
